A somewhat clone of Final Fantasy IV in Rust.

_DISCLAIMER_: This project will not include any assets from the original game. Tools will
be provided for extracting, but you will need to obtain a legal ISO of _Final Fantasy IV - Complete Collection_.

## Features

## Goals

- Provide a working recreation of Final Fantasy IV in a more customizable way

- Learn a newer graphics API such as Vulkan
- Learn how to use unsafe code
